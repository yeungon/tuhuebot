var longtext = `Understanding the Log Message
WAL File:

The Write-Ahead Log (WAL) is a mechanism used by Pebble (and many other databases) to ensure durability and consistency. It logs every write operation before applying the changes to the main database files.
In this message, demo/000005.log refers to a specific WAL file.
Log Number 000005:

This represents the unique identifier or sequence number for the WAL file. It helps the system know the order of operations and which WAL files are being processed.
Stopped Reading at Offset 36:

The "offset" refers to the byte position in the WAL file where Pebble stopped reading. In this case, it stopped reading at offset 36, likely because it reached the end of the WAL file, or there were no more records to process.
Replayed 1 Keys in 1 Batches:

This indicates that, during the replay of this WAL file, Pebble found 1 key (key-value pair) to process, and it was replayed as part of 1 batch.
Replaying is a process where Pebble reads the WAL file to apply the recorded changes into the main data structures (such as tables and SSTables). This is typically done during recovery after a crash or restart.
When This Log Might Occur
Recovery Process:

This log usually appears when Pebble is recovering from a previous state, such as when you restart the application or after a crash. It reads through the WAL files to make sure any uncommitted or pending changes are applied to the database.
Normal Database Operation:

The message can also appear during normal operation when Pebble is flushing the contents of a WAL file to SSTables (Sorted String Tables) and no more changes remain in that specific WAL.
Low Write Activity:

Since the log mentions that only 1 key was replayed, it suggests that there wasn't much recent write activity before this WAL file was closed or rotated. It might be typical if the database has low traffic or if a sync operation was triggered.
Implications
This message generally does not indicate an error; it's part of Pebble's normal operation, ensuring that data is safely written and applied.
If you encounter unexpected behavior or suspect a performance issue, check the logs for any other messages related to WAL or SSTables. Frequent flushing or replaying could indicate a configuration issue or a pattern of frequent writes that is affecting performance.
